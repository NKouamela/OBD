# Databases Project

The evaluation of the databases class is a presentation of a specific database. You can work in teams of 4 of your choosing.

You are working in a company which is looking to replace a relational DBMS currently in use. Each team should present a feasability study of a specific DBMS, showing its advantages, disadvantages, and use cases. Two different teams will work on each DBMS. We will organize the subjects on 10/02/2021, which is a work class dedicated to the project.

The DBMSs are:

1. [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/get-influxdb/), a distributed DBMS optimized for timeseries data
2. [Riak](http://basho.com/products/), a key/value DBMS inspired Amazon BD.
3. [HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/), a column-based DBMS inspired by BigTable
4. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/), a DBMS for documents used, for example, by CERN
5. [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/), a DBMS for documents used, for example, by Amadeus
6. [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/), a DBMS for graph databases
7. [Redis](http://redis.io/), a very efficient key/value DBMS

Each team should:

+ install their DBMS
+ test the DBMS on a relevant database (datasets from [Google](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/), and [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets))
+ compare their DBMS with a relational database system
+ prepare a presentation of their DBMS and example database which presents convincing argument for using this DBMS.

Presentations will take place on March 8th. You should upload your presentation materials to the LMS before midnight on March 7th.

# Databases

In this module on databases, database management systems will be covered, from basics and SQL to state-of-the-art DBMSs. Students will install and demonstrate the advantages of different DBMSs to their peers as a graded
project.

In this first class, we introduce the basics of database management systems and cover SQL in detail.

In the upcoming classes, students will need to install DBMSs on their local machines. For the [next class](0_2_postgres.md), students should install PostgreSQL.
